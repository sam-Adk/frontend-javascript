# Learning TypeScript

This repository contains my practice exercises and projects as I learn **TypeScript**.  
The goal is to understand the fundamentals of TypeScript, including:

- Basic types (string, number, boolean, etc.)
- Arrays, tuples, and enums
- Functions and type annotations
- Interfaces and type aliases
- Classes and inheritance
- Modules and imports/exports
- Using TypeScript with tools like Webpack

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds **static typing** to JavaScript, making code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.  
It also provides features like IntelliSense and better error detection during development.

## Current Progress

- Setting up TypeScript with a project
- Writing simple code examples
- Compiling TypeScript into JavaScript
- Running code in Node.js and the browser

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced TypeScript features
- Build small projects with TypeScript
- Learn how to integrate TypeScript with frameworks like React
